            First star: <br>
            This wireframe had the format <br>
            of the descriptions alternating <br>
            between the left and right side <br>
             of each project


         </p>

         <p class="star2">

            Second star: <br>
            This wireframe was intended to make <br>
            the text appear when you hover over <br>
            the picture. However, I realized that it <br>
            is done with JavaScript… 


         </p>

         <p class="star3">

            Third star: <br>
            Here, I was debating whether or not <br>
            to put the menu as a bar or in the corner. <br>
            I especially liked the idea of having the <br>
            text in the landing page overlap a picture <br>
            in the background that took up half the space


         </p>

         <p class="star4">

            Fourth star: <br>
            I liked the idea of having an “Explore” <br>
            button on the landing page and nothing  <br>
            else,so the user had to click the button  <br>
            in order to advance with viewing the  <br>
            rest of the content in the website

        <p class="left">
            The left wireframe includes text in the 
            landing page overlap a picture in the 
            background that took up half the space 
            combined with the descriptions of the 
            projects appear on the sides of the 
            pictures of the projects

        </p>

        <p class="middle">
            The middle wireframe includes the menu 
            as a bar along with an explore button 
            on the landing page plus text that appears 
            when you hover over a picture

        </p>

        <p class="right">
            The right wireframe incldues an explore
             button on landing page combined with a 
             condensed, collage type of display of projects
